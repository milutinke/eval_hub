  """Computes the MRCR V2 metric.

  This metric uses difflib SequenceMatcher to compute a notion of approximate
  edit distance between the target reference and the model's output, scaled
  to lie within [0, 1]. 1 is a perfect match, 0 is a non-match. Additionally,
  the metric score is 0 if the random string is not the first 12 characters of
  the output (after stripping whitespace). For outputs where there are multiple
  matches of the random string, we keep only the last one and only consider the
  substring of the output following this last match.

  Args:
    prediction: The model's output.
    target: The target output. Note that it contains the random hash string as a
      prefix.

  Returns:
    The MRCR V2 metric score contained in the interval [0, 1].
